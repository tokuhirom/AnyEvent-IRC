- replace i by I and:
      16:52:25 <pippijn>        I tried to preserve the case in all channel and nicknames Net::IRC3::Client::Connection passes to hi s user. But in the inter‐
      16:52:28 <pippijn>        nal structures i’m using lower case for the channel names.

- fix channel case in Net::IRC3::Client::Connection
- add CTCP!
- add mode info to nicknames?
- add mode command handling?
- add TOPIC support
- rework channel framework => make some real objects
- add support for KILL!
- capture error 433/ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE if the automatic renamer is active
