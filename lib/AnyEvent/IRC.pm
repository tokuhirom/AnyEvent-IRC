=head1 VERSION

Version 0.8

our $VERSION = '0.8';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Using the simplistic L<AnyEvent::IRC::Connection>:

   use AnyEvent;
   use AnyEvent::IRC::Connection;

   my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

   my $con = new AnyEvent::IRC::Connection;

   $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);

   $con->reg_cb (
      connect => sub {
         my ($con) = @_;
         $con->send_msg (NICK => 'testbot');
         $con->send_msg (USER => 'testbot', '*', '0', 'testbot');
      },
      irc_001 => sub {
         my ($con) = @_;
         print "$_[1]->{prefix} says I'm in the IRC: $_[1]->{params}->[-1]!\n";
         $c->broadcast;
      }
   );

   $c->wait;

Using the more sophisticated L<AnyEvent::IRC::Client>:

   use AnyEvent;
   use AnyEvent::IRC::Client;

   my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

   my $timer;
   my $con = new AnyEvent::IRC::Client;

   $con->reg_cb (registered => sub { print "I'm in!\n"; });
   $con->reg_cb (disconnect => sub { print "I'm out!\n"; $c->broadcast });
   $con->reg_cb (
      sent => sub {
         my ($con) = @_;

         if ($_[2] eq 'PRIVMSG') {
            print "Sent message!\n";

            $timer = AnyEvent->timer (
               after => 1,
               cb => sub {
                  undef $timer;
                  $con->disconnect ('done')
               }
            );
         }
      }
   );

   $con->send_srv (
      PRIVMSG => 'elmex',
      "Hello there I'm the cool AnyEvent::IRC test script!"
   );

   $con->connect ("localhost", 6667, { nick => 'testbot' });
   $c->wait;
   $con->disconnect;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<AnyEvent::IRC> module consists of L<AnyEvent::IRC::Connection>,
L<AnyEvent::IRC::Client> and L<AnyEvent::IRC::Util>. L<AnyEvent::IRC>
is just a module that holds this overview over the other modules.

L<AnyEvent::IRC> can be viewed as toolbox for handling IRC connections
and communications. It won't do everything for you, and you still
need to know a few details of the IRC protocol.

L<AnyEvent::IRC::Client> is a more highlevel IRC connection
that already processes some messages for you and will generated some
events that are maybe useful to you. It will also do PING replies for you,
manage channels a bit, nicknames and CTCP.

L<AnyEvent::IRC::Connection> is a lowlevel connection that only connects
to the server and will let you send and receive IRC messages.
L<AnyEvent::IRC::Connection> does not imply any client behaviour, you could also
use it to implement an IRC server.

Note that these modules use L<AnyEvent> as it's IO event subsystem.
You can integrate them into any application with a event system
that L<AnyEvent> has support for (eg. L<Gtk2> or L<Event>).
