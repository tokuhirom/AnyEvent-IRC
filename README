NAME
    AnyEvent::IRC - An event system independend IRC protocol module

VERSION
    Version 0.6

SYNOPSIS
    Using the simplistic AnyEvent::IRC::Connection:

       use AnyEvent;
       use AnyEvent::IRC::Connection;

       my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

       my $con = new AnyEvent::IRC::Connection;

       $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);

       $con->reg_cb (
          connect => sub {
             my ($con) = @_;
             $con->send_msg (NICK => 'testbot');
             $con->send_msg (USER => 'testbot', '*', '0', 'testbot');
          },
          irc_001 => sub {
             my ($con) = @_;
             print "$_[1]->{prefix} says i'm in the IRC: $_[1]->{params}->[-1]!\n";
             $c->broadcast;
          }
       );

       $c->wait;

    Using the more sophisticated AnyEvent::IRC::Client:

       use AnyEvent;
       use AnyEvent::IRC::Client;

       my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

       my $timer;
       my $con = new AnyEvent::IRC::Client;

       $con->reg_cb (registered => sub { print "I'm in!\n"; });
       $con->reg_cb (disconnect => sub { print "I'm out!\n"; $c->broadcast });
       $con->reg_cb (
          sent => sub {
             my ($con) = @_;

             if ($_[2] eq 'PRIVMSG') {
                print "Sent message!\n";

                $timer = AnyEvent->timer (
                   after => 1,
                   cb => sub {
                      undef $timer;
                      $con->disconnect ('done')
                   }
                );
             }
          }
       );

       $con->send_srv (
          PRIVMSG => 'elmex',
          "Hello there i'm the cool AnyEvent::IRC test script!"
       );

       $con->connect ("localhost", 6667, { nick => 'testbot' });
       $c->wait;
       $con->disconnect;

DESCRIPTION
    The AnyEvent::IRC module consists of AnyEvent::IRC::Connection,
    AnyEvent::IRC::Client and AnyEvent::IRC::Util. AnyEvent::IRC is just a
    module that holds this overview over the other modules.

    AnyEvent::IRC can be viewed as toolbox for handling IRC connections and
    communications. It won't do everything for you, and you still need to
    know a few details of the IRC protocol.

    AnyEvent::IRC::Client is a more highlevel IRC connection that already
    processes some messages for you and will generated some events that are
    maybe useful to you. It will also do PING replies for you, manage
    channels a bit, nicknames and CTCP.

    AnyEvent::IRC::Connection is a lowlevel connection that only connects to
    the server and will let you send and receive IRC messages.
    AnyEvent::IRC::Connection does not imply any client behaviour, you could
    also use it to implement an IRC server.

    Note that these modules use AnyEvent as it's IO event subsystem. You can
    integrate them into any application with a event system that AnyEvent
    has support for (eg. Gtk2 or Event).
