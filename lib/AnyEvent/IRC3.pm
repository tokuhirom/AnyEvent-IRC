our $VERSION = '0.5';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Using the simplistic L<Net::IRC3::Connection>:

   use AnyEvent;
   use Net::IRC3::Connection;

   my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

   my $con = new Net::IRC3::Connection;

   $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);

   $con->reg_cb (irc_001 => sub { print "$_[1]->{prefix} says i'm in the IRC: $_[1]->{trailing}!\n"; $c->broadcast; 0 });
   $con->send_msg (undef, NICK => undef, "testbot");
   $con->send_msg (undef, USER => 'testbot', "testbot", '*', '0');

   $c->wait;

Using the more sophisticatd L<Net::IRC3::Client::Connection>:

   use AnyEvent;
   use Net::IRC3::Client::Connection;

   my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

   my $timer;
   my $con = new Net::IRC3::Client::Connection;

   $con->reg_cb (registered => sub { print "I'm in!\n"; 0 });
   $con->reg_cb (disconnect => sub { print "I'm out!\n"; 0 });
   $con->reg_cb (
      sent => sub {
         if ($_[2] eq 'PRIVMSG') {
            print "Sent message!\n";
            $timer = AnyEvent->timer (after => 1, cb => sub { $c->broadcast });
         }
         1
      }
   );

   $con->send_srv (PRIVMSG => "Hello there i'm the cool Net::IRC3 test script!", 'elmex');

   $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);
   $con->register (qw/testbot testbot testbot/);

   $c->wait;
   undef $timer;

   $con->disconnect;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Net::IRC3> module consists of L<Net::IRC3::Connection>, L<Net::IRC3::Client::Connection>
and L<Net::IRC3::Util>. L<Net::IRC3> only contains this documentation.
It manages connections and parses and constructs IRC messages.

L<Net::IRC3> can be viewed as toolbox for handling IRC connections
and communications. It won't do everything for you, and you still
need to know a few details of the IRC protocol.

L<Net::IRC3::Client::Connection> is a more highlevel IRC connection
that already processes some messages for you and will generated some
events that are maybe useful to you. It will also do PING replies for you
and manage channels a bit.

L<Net::IRC3::Connection> is a lowlevel connection that only connects
to the server and will let you send and receive IRC messages.
L<Net::IRC3::Connection> does not imply any client behaviour, you could also
use it to implement an IRC server.

Note that the *::Connection module uses AnyEvent as it's IO event subsystem.
You can integrate them into any application with a event system
that AnyEvent has support for (eg. L<Gtk2> or L<Event>).
